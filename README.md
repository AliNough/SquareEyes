1. Summary

Initial streaming service website "Square Eyes"

Here is my thought process and overall reasoning desicions i made through out the process.

I started with landing page which is ofc the landing page. Did not need a lot of stuff here. a background image - which the design aspect and relevancy can be discussed - the logo and cta buton below.

For header i chose to stick with smaller croppted version of the original logo (which by the way was very difficult to work with but i tried my best). 
Although the design I initially made had the sign in buutton under the CTA button, i decided to place it in right side of header section, along with about link and a contact link. I tried to make the color for sign up and sign in button diffrent to indicate these are indeed diffrent button
