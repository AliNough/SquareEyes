1. Summary

Initial streaming service website "Square Eyes"

Here is my thought process and overall reasoning desicions i made through out the process.

Landing page:
    I started with landing page which is ofc the landing page. Did not need a lot of stuff here. a background image - which the design aspect and relevancy can be discussed - the logo and cta buton below.

    For header i chose to stick with smaller croppted version of the original logo (which by the way was very difficult to work with but i tried my best). 
    Although the design I initially made had the sign in buutton under the CTA button, i decided to place it in right side of header section, along with about link and a contact link. I tried to make the color for sign up and sign in button diffrent to indicate these are indeed diffrent button, plus I could't make it the same color because of the headers color was also red.

    The challange of this side was to make the hamburger menu which appears when screen is 690px or below, to be in front of the logo, this was a really frustrating problem and one i was not able to solve unfortunatly. but it seems to work fine in all other pages.

Log in page:
    Unfortunatly I did not manage to make the Sign Up page in time, I was too muched hunged up on the browse page and product page that honestly i forgot, not that it would be difficult to make the form though. 

    The Logg in page or sign in page is pretty straight forward, you type in your email and password and press sign in, I shoud have made a forgot password link though... my bad. In the styling I got lazy and just imported the styles from index because I didn't want to make the same header every time and take up unnecessary lines in CSS page.

Browse Page:
    Maybe the most time consuming page. I decided to use grid for this one. It was very confusing at first and I was overjoyed when I finaly understood grid and made it work. 

    I started with a main container that is slit in 2 parts. One for aside which is placed on the left and one for all the contents on the right.

    On the main content section I wanted to make it another grid so I could have multiple columns to put my actual products. I chose to repeate 3 of the same columns "continue watching", "newly added" and "trending" and in each of those we would have another grid that gives us 8 rows and contain individual items with background images. I must admit I was much more fund of using background image instead of img becasuse I thought it would be easier to add stuff in front of the images such as the play button or product title. Since img tag is self closing it was not ideal for what i had planned, maybe I was wrong but thats how I decided to solve my challange. 

    the challange I was not able to solve however, was to make the chevrons to actually work, I wanted to search google for it but I was afraid that that would be considered "cheating"

    in respect to responsiveness of the screen, I was able to make each product section scrollable but the dots that indicate what page you're in does not work.

Product Page:
    I wanted the user to be able to see all the informations before deciding to play the movie. Now I know that the actual play button can be hard to find for peaple who dont think to hover the mouse over the product image but that was just a learning experiment I did, make the play button appear when hovering over the image and I was really excited to make it work.

    To the right I added a section for movie trailer that in retroperspective is a bit unnecessary specially in small screens like 320px smartphones.
